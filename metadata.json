  "description": "A simulation exploring the emergence of Conway's Game of Life from a discrete wavefunction system. The application models a lattice of qubits evolving through a cycle of local unitary transformations and controlled decoherence, demonstrating how classical cellular automaton rules can arise as stable attractors in a quantum-like system.",
